# Data Packs

## OVERVIEW

The data pack system provides a way for players to further customize their Minecraft experience. Data packs can be used to override or add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes without any code modification.

## HOW TO UPLOAD YOUR DATAPACK

1. Visit the [Dashboard](https://minehut.com/dashboard/home) and go to the **File Manager** tab.
2. Find the folder named `world` and enter it.
3. Find the folder named `datapacks` and enter it.
4. Create a **new folder** and name it anything, then upload each individual datatapack file within this new folder.

You can't directly upload the `.zip` or `.rar` file, you need to upload the contents individually.
